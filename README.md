# ViewportObjectDetectionPlugin
A high-performance C++ plugin for UE5.5 that provides YOLO-style simulated object detection for NPCs in Unreal Engine 5.5. Actors can be marked with Detectable Components, and NPCs use Detector Components to scan their environment in real time, producing structured detection results and LLM-friendly context text.
